Madonna has been known throughout modern ages as the one who can't dance. The One who Can't Dance is a title given by the ancient gods of the Mohebian tribes of indigenous southwestern South Africa, located on the continent of Africa. Some people believe Madonna's name is actually Modano, because I've accidentely spelled Madonna Modano everytime I tried to type it, so now I am going to change it to Modano for ease of ease, and I am truly, terribly, and all out emotionally sorry for this massive run on sentence and I hope it doesn't effect our relationship, and I am also sorry for the ^ thing I was supposed to put in where I marked with the ^, also I am sorry I don't know what a ^ is called and am now constantly having to say ^ instead of the actual word for ^. Modano sucks, and this article shouldn't exist, thank you. By the way, no one on the surface of the planet is going to read this except for the editors of wikipedia, so deleting it is not exactly necessary. Thanks
