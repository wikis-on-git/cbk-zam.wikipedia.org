Climaco would first win election as Zamboanga City mayor in [[Philippine general election, 1955|1955]], as a candidate of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], and served in such capacity until 1961. 

===Mayor (first two terms)===

Climaco would become a national figure during his first stint as Zamboanga City mayor. He would become known for his personal courage, as shown by his willingness to venture alone out to hotspots and personally confronting neighborhood toughies with threats of imprisonment.<ref name=tgf7/> He maintained a similarly tough stance towards the city's policemen, once disarming cops he caught asleep at their posts during a surprise inspections.<ref name=tgf8>Guingona, p. 198</ref> Climaco also maintained a harmonious relationship with the city's Muslim population,<ref name=star/><ref name=tgf4>Guingona, p. 204</ref> and cracked down on gambling.<ref name=star/>

As mayor, Climaco ordered the construction of Abong-Abong park in [[Pasonanca, Zamboanga City|Pasonanca]], which was planned to provide space for a camp site, housing projects, and a shantytown to house the city's homeless population.<ref>Guingona, p. 201</ref> During this period, Zamboanga City would earn the appellation as the cleanest city in the Philippines.<ref name=pdf/> One measure he enacted to earn such a reputation for his city was a directive requiring all horses in horse-drawn carriages to be tied with diapers beneath their tails as they plied their routes.<ref name=star/>

He struck a friendship with the mayor of Manila, [[Arsenio Lacson]], who had earned a similar reputation for toughness and good governance. Climaco soon earned the nickname "Arsenio Lacson of the South"<ref name=star>{{cite news |first=Max |last=Soliven |authorlink=Max Soliven |title=Remembering the ‘Cesar’ of Zambo |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=54743 |work=By the Way |publisher=Philippine Star |date=2006-10-31 |accessdate=2008-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=tgf8/> , to which Lacson remarked that at the rate Climaco was going, the Manila mayor would soon be known as the "Climaco of the North."<ref name=tgf8/>

===Macapagal administration official===

In [[Philippine general election, 1961|1961]], Climaco gave up his post as mayor for an unsuccessful run for the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] under the Liberal Party. After his defeat, he was appointed by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Diosdado Macapagal]] as Commissioner of Customs. As Customs Commissioner, he brought in cadets from the [[Philippine Military Academy]], vaunted for their idealism and honesty, to work in a Bureau of Customs which had long been reputedly corrupt.<ref name=tgf9>Guingona, p. 199</ref> He again ran and lost for a Senate seat in 1963. Climaco then was appointed as a Presidential Assistant under Macapagal.

In [[Philippine general election, 1965|1965]], Climaco tried for a third time to win election as a Senator. He fell only around 4,000 votes shy of winning a seat in the Senate. In the same election, his political ally, President Macapagal, was defeated for re-election by a law school contemporary and friend of Climaco's, [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. 

===Mayor (third term)===

President Marcos declared martial law in 1972. Distressed at the development, Climaco left for exile to the [[United States]]<ref name=pdf/> He vowed never to cut his hair until democratic rule was restored in the country.<ref name=tgf0>{{cite book |title=The Gallant Filipino |last=Guingona |first=Teofisto |authorlink=Teofisto Guingona |year=1993 |publisher=Anvil Publishing Inc. |location=[[Pasig City]] |isbn=971-27-0279-0 |pages= 200}}</ref> He returned to the Philippines in 1976, and two years later, sought election to the [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] as a member from Zamboanga. He was defeated in this effort.

In 1980, Climaco staged his political comeback when he won re-election as Zamboanga City mayor under the banner of a political party he had organized, the Concerned Citizen's Aggrupation.<ref name=pdf/> By this time, crime and violence, often at the hands of policemen and the military, had become prevalent in the city<ref name=time/><ref name=tgf2>Guingona, p. 202</ref>, and a frustrated Climaco posted a scoreboard in front of city hall listing a running tally of unsolved violent crimes in the city.<ref name=time>{{cite news |title=Murder in Broad Daylight |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926995,00.html |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=1984-11-26 |accessdate=2008-01-26 }}</ref><ref name=tgf2/> Climaco did not hesitate in denouncing the military and the police in the city, and had the police chief transferred out of the city.<ref name=tgf3>Climaco, p. 203</ref> Upon the outbreak of violent incidents in the city, Climaco would rush to the scene on board his motorcycle and quell the disruption.<ref>Guingona, p. 191-192</ref> Despite the threats of violence, Climaco never carried a gun or surrounded himself with bodygaurds.<ref name=star/>

Climaco maintained a harsh view towards the Marcos government. He was critical of the highly-centralized structure of government under which it was necessary to obtain the blessing of the Office of the President before funds could be disbursed.<ref name=star/> When President Marcos lifted martial law in 1981, Climaco retorted, "Marcos did not lift martial rule. He only tilted it."<ref>Guingona, p. 206</ref> Climaco was able to stoke anti-Marcos sentiment within Zamboanga City.<ref>{{cite news |first=Pamela G. |last=Hollie |title=A Mayor in Southern Philippines Taunts Marcos |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10A10FC3F5F0C738EDDAF0894DA484D81&scp=4&sq=Cesar+Climaco&st=nyt  |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=1982-06-20 |accessdate=2008-01-25 }}</ref>  When [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] was assassinated in 1983, Climaco renamed one of the city's main squares as "Aquino Plaza".<ref name=star/>

In [[Philippine parliamentary election, 1984|1984]], Climaco successfully sought election as a Member of Parliament in the [[Batasang Pambansa]]. Climaco however declined to assume his seat until he had completed his six-year term as mayor, a stance that was seen as an act of defiance against the Marcos government.<ref name=pdf/>

==Assassination==

In the morning of November 14, 1984, Climaco rushed to the scene of a fire that had broken out in downtown Zamboanga City. He supervised operations to put out the fire, then prepared to leave. He sighted a display of caskets at a nearby [[funeral home]] and jokingly said, "reserve one of those for me". <ref name=tgf92>Guingona, p. 192</ref> Climaco then mounted his motorcycle to return to his office. A man approached from behind the mayor and shot him in the nape at point-blank range.<ref name=tgf92/> The assassin escaped, while Climaco was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital.

The crowd that attended Climaco's [[funeral]] in Zamboanga City was estimated as ranging from fifteen thousand people <ref name=pdf/> to up to two hundred thousand people <ref name=zamb> {{cite news |first=John L. |last=Shinn III |title=Special Edition: The 1984 Assassination of Mayor Cesar Climaco |url=http://www.lazamboangatimes.com/cesar_climaco_latest001.html |publisher=L.A. Zamboanga Times |date=2003| accessdate=2008-01-26 }}</ref>. He was buried at Abong-Abong Park.

To date, nobody has been convicted for Climaco's assassination. Police and military officials pinned the blame on a Muslim group led by Rizal Alih,<ref name=tgf4/><ref name=zamb/> but attempts to apprehend him were unsuccessful. Climaco's widow publicly expressed that it was the military who was behind the murder.<ref name=zamb/> Climaco himself was said to have remarked before his death that if he were ever assassinated, the military would blame Alih for the murder.<ref name=tgf4/>

==Legacy==

Climaco's son, Julio Cesar, would be appointed Zamboanga City OIC mayor in 1986, and served in that post until the following year. His niece, Beng Climaco, was elected in 2007 to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], representing the [[Legislative_districts_of_Zamboanga_City#1st_District|1st District of Zamboanga City]].
