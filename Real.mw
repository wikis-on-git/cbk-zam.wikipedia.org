[[Spain|Spanish]] forces landed at the site of Real early in the colonization period, calling it ''Puerto Real''. Spanish galleons and ships docked at the port reinforced forces stationed at the nearby place "Binangonan del Ampon" known now as [[Infanta, Quezon|Infanta]].

Formerly a barrio of [[Infanta, Quezon|Infanta]], Real was created into a municipal district with a set of government comprising the barrios of Llavac, Cawayan, Capalong, Tignoan, Kiloloron, Lubayat and Pandan which were all segregated from the mothertown of Infanta. This was by the virtue of Executive Order No. 410 dated [[December 15]], [[1960]] by President [[Carlos P. Garcia]].
