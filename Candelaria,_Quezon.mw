==History==
Candelaria began as a series of [[barangay]]s that were part of neighbouring municipalities. In [[1885]], the Governor General of the Philippines granted a permit allowing the establishment of an independent government which would manage the barangays. Its boundaries were created through the signing of a treaty by the leaders of [[Tiaong, Quezon|Tiaong]], [[Sariaya, Quezon|Sariaya]], and the founding families of Candelaria.

In [[1902]], Candelaria sought the help of Sariayaya at a period when general hostilities against the [[United States|Americans]] was on the downswing. In [[1908]], it became an independent fourth-class municipality.

During the American regime, the town grew, as homes and public buildings were constructed, and industry and commerce came to fruition. When the [[Japan|Japanese]] invaded during the [[Second World War]], Candelaria's growth regressed and town became impoverished.

On [[June 6]], [[1946]], Candelaria was liberated from the hold of the Japanese Imperial Army.
