El '''corazon''' es un [[musculo]] [[organ (anatomia)|organ]] que tiene porma de peras que ta puede encuntra na maga [[vertebrata]] y amo el responsable por el bombiada del [[sangre]] na maga [[vaso del sangre]] con repetido y de ritmo contraccion, o un similar clase de estractura na maga [[anelido]], [[molusko]] y [[artropodo]]s<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kmle.com/search.php?Search=heart | title = ''KMLE Medical Dictionary Definition of heart'' | author = [http://www.kmle.com The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary]}}.</ref> The term ''cardiac'' (as in [[cardiology]]) means "related to the heart" and comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] καρδιά, ''kardia'', for "heart." The heart is composed of [[cardiac muscle]], an [[involuntary muscle]] tissue which is found only within this organ.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kmle.com/search.php?Search=cardiac | title = ''KMLE Medical Dictionary Definition of cardiac'' | author = [http://www.kmle.com The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary]}}</ref>

==Early development==
{{main|Heart development}}
[[Image:EHR-BBII.jpg|thumb|right|300px|At 21 days after [[Fertilisation|conception]], the human heart rate begins beating at 75-80 beats per minute and accelerates linearly for the first month of beating.]]
The human embryonic heart begins beating approximately 21 days after conception, or five weeks after the last normal menstrual period (LMP), which is the date normally used to date pregnancy.  The human heart begins beating at a rate near the mother’s, about 75-80 beats per minute (bpm). The embryonic heart rate (EHR) then accelerates linearly for the first month of beating, peaking at 165-185 bpm during the early 7th week, (early 9th week after the LMP). This acceleration is approximately 3.3 bpm per day, or about 10 bpm every three days, an increase of 100 bpm in the first month.   [http://www.obgyn.net/us/us.asp?page=/us/cotm/0001/ehr2000]

After peaking at about 9.2 weeks after the LMP, it decelerates to about 150 bpm (+/-25 bpm) during the 15th week after the LMP. After the 15th week the deceleration slows reaching an average rate of about 145 (+/-25 bpm) bpm at term. The regression formula which describes this acceleration before the embryo reaches 25 mm in crown-rump length or 9.2 LMP weeks is:

Age in days = EHR(0.3)+6

See: [http://www.obgyn.net/us/us.asp?page=/us/cotm/0001/ehr2000 Embryonic Heart Rates Compared in Assisted and Non-Assisted Pregnancies]

There is no difference in male and female heart rates before birth.<ref>Terry J. DuBose [http://www.obgyn.net/english/pubs/features/dubose/ehr-age.htm Sex, Heart Rate and Age]</ref>

==Structure==  	 
[[Image:3DScience_Human_Heart.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Anterior (frontal) view of the opened heart. Arrows indicate normal blood flow. Image provided courtesy of www.3dscience.com.]]

In the human body, the heart is normally situated to the left of the middle of the [[thorax]], underneath the [[breastbone]] (see [http://www.easyrashi.com/TEFILLIN/Position_of_heart.htm diagrams]). The heart is usually felt to be on the left side because the [[left heart]] (left ventricle) is stronger (it pumps to all body parts). The left lung is smaller than the right lung because the heart occupies more of the left hemithorax. The heart is enclosed by a sac known as the [[pericardium]] and is surrounded by the [[lung]]s. The pericardium is a double membrane structure containing a [[serous]] fluid to reduce friction during heart contractions. The [[mediastinum]], a subdivision of the thoracic cavity, is the name of the heart cavity. 

The ''apex'' is the blunt point situated in an inferior (pointing down and left) direction. A stethoscope can be placed directly over the apex so that the beats can be counted. This physical location is between the sixth and seventh rib, just to the left of the sternum [http://www.easyrashi.com/TEFILLIN/sternum.htm]. In normal adults, the mass of the heart is 250-350 [[gram|g]] (9-12 oz), or about three fourths the size of a clenched fist, but extremely diseased hearts can be up to 1000 g (2 lb) in mass due to [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]]. It consists of four chambers, the two upper ''atria'' (singular: atrium
) and the two lower ''ventricles''.  On the left is a picture of a fresh human heart which was removed from a 64-year-old British male.  

[[Image:Humhrt2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Human heart]]

The function of the right side of the heart (see [[right heart]]) is to collect deoxygenated blood, in the [[right atrium]], from the body and pump it, via the [[right ventricle]], into the lungs ([[pulmonary circulation]]) so that carbon dioxide can be dropped off and oxygen picked up ([[gas exchange]]). This happens through a passive process called [[diffusion]]. The left side (see [[left heart]]) collects oxygenated blood from the [[lung]]s into the [[left atrium]].  From the left atrium the blood moves to the [[left ventricle]] which pumps it out to the body.  On both sides, the lower ventricles are thicker and stronger than the upper atria.
The muscle wall surrounding the left ventricle is thicker than the wall surrounding the right ventricle due to the higher force needed to pump the blood through the [[systemic circulation]].

==First aid==
''See [[cardiac arrest]] for emergencies involving the heart''

If a person is encountered in cardiac arrest (no heartbeat), [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) should be started, and [[call for help|help called]]. If an [[automated external defibrillator]] is available, this device may automatically administer [[defibrillation]] if this is indicated.
 
==Food use==
The hearts of [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, [[chicken]]s and certain [[fowl]] are consumed as [[food]] in many countries. They are counted among [[offal]], but being a muscle, the taste of heart is much more like regular meat than that of other offal. It resembles [[venison]] in structure and taste.

==As a symbol==
{{details|Heart (symbol)}}
The heart was historically seen by some as the seat of the soul and the organ responsible for human thought. Even though we now know that the heart has nothing to do with thought or love, people still carry on using the term "heart" metaphorically when talking about love. When used in this metaphorical sense, the heart is often illustrated as an [[icon]] (<font size=+4 color="red">♥</font>). 

The term "heart" can also refer to the core or centre of anything e.g. "The heart of the matter".
