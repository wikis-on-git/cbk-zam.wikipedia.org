===Physical===

Quezon is a long province having an area of 8,706.6 km². The northern part of the province sandwiched between the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain range and the [[Philippine Sea]]. The southern part consists of the [[Tayabas Isthmus]], which separates the [[Bicol Peninsula]] from the main part of [[Luzon Island]], and the [[Bondoc Peninsula]] which lies between [[Tayabas Bay]] and [[Ragay Gulf]].

The major islands of Quezon are [[Alabat Island]] and [[Polillo Islands]]. [[Mount Banahaw|Mt. Banahaw]], an extinct volcano, is the highest peak at 2,188 m. It supplies [[geothermal power]] to the Makban Geothermal Power Plant.

==History==

Originally, what now forms part of Quezon was divided among the provinces of [[Batangas]], [[Laguna province|Laguna]], and [[Nueva Ecija]]. The area was first explored by [[Juan de Salcedo]] in [[1571]]-[[1572]], during his expedition from [[Laguna province|Laguna]] to [[Camarines]] provinces.

In [[1591]], the province was created and called ''Kaliraya'' or ''Kalilayan'', after the capital town which later became [[Unisan, Quezon|Unisan]]. In about the middle of the [[1700s|18th century]], the capital was transferred to the town of [[Tayabas, Quezon|Tayabas]], from which the province got its new name.

Depredation and plunder by the [[Moros]] were rampant during the [[Spain|Spanish]] regime, because they opposed the colonizers, especially in their efforts to spread [[Christianity]]. The destruction of Kalilayan in [[1604]] by a big fleet of moro pirates caused the inhabitants to transfer to Palsabangon ([[Pagbilao, Quezon|Pagbilao]]).

However, even the colonized people grew discontent with the Spaniards over the centuries. The most important event in the history of the province was the [[Confradia Revolt]] in [[1841]], which was led by the famous [[Lucban, Quezon|Lucbano]], Apolinario dela Cruz, popularly known as [[Hermano Pule]]. The province, under [[Miguel Malvar|Gen. Miguel Malvar]], was also among the earliest to join the [[Philippine Revolution]]. The [[Philippine Revolutionary Government|Revolutionary Government]] took control over the province on [[August 15]], [[1898]].

The [[United States|American]]s then came and annexed the Philippines. A civil government was established in the province on [[March 2]], [[1901]], with [[Lucena City|Lucena]] as its capital.

[[Japan|Japanese]] occupation of the province during [[World War II]] began on [[December 23]], [[1941]], when the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] landed in [[Atimonan, Quezon|Atimonan]]. The occupation witnessed the brutal murders of prominent sons of Tayabas. [[April 4]], [[1945]] was the day the province was liberated as the American army reached Lucena.

despues de la guerra, el[[7 de septiembre]], [[1946]], [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 14 changed the name Tayabas to Quezon, in honor of [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] president who hailed from [[Baler, Aurora|Baler]], which was one of the province's towns.

In [[1951]], the northern part of Quezon was made into the sub-province of [[Aurora, Philippines|Aurora]] (which included Baler). Aurora was the name of the president's wife, [[Aurora A. Quezon]]. In [[1979]], Aurora was finally separated from Quezon as an independent province.
