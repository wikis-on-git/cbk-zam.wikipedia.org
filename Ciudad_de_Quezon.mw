'''Quezon City''' <b title="Pronunciation: ke&prime;zon, /"kEZO:n/" style="position:relative;top:-0.3em;font-size:0.75em;color:#666;">P</b>
([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Lungsod ng Quezon''), is the former capital and the most populous city in the [[Philippines]]. Located on the island of [[Luzon]], Quezon City (popularly known to Filipinos as simply ''QC'') is one of the [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] and [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]] that comprise [[Metro Manila]], the National Capital Region. The city was named after [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the former [[President of the Philippines|president]] of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] who founded the city and developed it to replace [[Manila]] as the country's capital. Quezon City is not located in and should not be confused with [[Quezon]] province, which was also named after the president.

Being the former capital, many government offices are located in the city, including the [[Batasang Pambansa]], the seat of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], which is the lower chamber in the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]]. The main campuses of noteworthy Philippine universities such as the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and the [[University of the Philippines]] are also located here.

Quezon City is the richest local government unit in the country in terms of current assets, cash in banks, share of internal revenue allotment (IRA), gross income, and gross net income. It remains the only Philippine city without any debt to banks as it operates on a surplus fund of over 2 billion pesos. The city features many spacious parks, tree-lined boulevards, and lots of commercial areas, popular with shoppers all over the metropolis. Most of the city is composed of residential areas.

Quezon City is also the major [[entertainment]] capital of the Philippines, as many Filipino [[Television|TV Shows]], [[Music of the Philippines|music]], and [[Cinema of the Philippines|movies]] are produced here. The major [[TV networks]] in the Philippines have their main stations in Quezon City. 

In [[1984]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] built the scenic [[Manila Philippines Temple]] here because of the large number of members in the region. The [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] installed in Quezon City their headquarters on Commonwealth Avenue, New Era barangay: center of operations as well as a large temple and the [[New Era University]]. 

However, the majority of the population is Roman Catholic, and in [[2002]], Quezon City was made see for two new Catholic dioceses: ''Cubao'' and ''Novaliches'', as the very populous Archdiocese of Manila was carved up and five new dioceses created.

==Geografia==  es la ciudad más grande adentro [[metro Manila]]. En aproximadamente 160 kilómetros cuadrados, cubre casi un cuarto del área de [[metro Manila]]. La ciudad miente en una meseta relativamente alta en la esquina nordestal de la metrópoli entre las tierras bajas de [[Manila]] al sudoeste y [[río de Marikina]] al valle al este. La porción meridional es drenada por el muy estrecho [[río del San Juan]] y sus tributarios [[río de Pasig]], mientras que el funcionamiento en las porciones norteñas de la ciudad es el río igualmente estrecho de Tullahan. La ciudad de Quezon se confina cerca [[Manila]] al sudoeste, cerca [[ciudad de Caloocan]] y [[ciudad de Valenzuela]] al oeste y al noroeste. A las mentiras del sur [[San Juan, metro Manila|San Juan]] y [[ciudad de Mandaluyong]] mientras que [[ciudad de Marikina]] y [[ciudad de Pasig]] confina la ciudad de Quezon al sureste. Del norte a las mentiras a través [[río de Marilao]] [[San Jose del Monte City]] en la provincia [[Bulacan]] y a las mentiras del este [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]] y [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]], ambos en la provincia de [[Rizal]]. La ciudad se puede dividir en un número de áreas. La porción meridional de la ciudad, donde la mayor parte de están los lugares interesantes, se divide en un número de lugares incluyendo Diliman, la Commonwealth, las áreas del proyecto, el Cubao, el Kamias-Kamuning, Manila nuevo, San Francisco del Monte y Sta. Alturas del Mesa. La mitad norteña de la ciudad se llama Novaliches y contiene a menudo las áreas de Fairview y de Lagro. La mayor parte de estas áreas no tienen ningún límite definido y son sobre todo residenciales en naturaleza.

==Sub-divisions==
===Diliman===
[[Image:QCMemorialCircle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Quezon Memorial]] at Quezon City.]]
Diliman, located at the center of southern Quezon City, is where many government offices are located, including the City Hall. Diliman is also home to the main campus of the [[University of the Philippines, Diliman|University of the Philippines]]. [[Far Eastern University]]'s Institute of Technology (now FEU-[[Far Eastern University - Nicanor Reyes Educational Foundation|FERN College]]) 15-hectare campus is located at the central portion of Diliman.

At Diliman's center lies the [[Quezon Memorial]] where [[Manuel L. Quezon|Pres. Manuel L. Quezon]] is interred. The monument, encased in marble, is the highest structure in that part of the city. Running around the monument is the 2-kilometer Quezon Memorial Circle, also known as the Elliptical Road (R-7). The circle links Commonwealth (R-7), Visayas, Kalayaan, East, North, and Quezon Avenues (R-7). The last three avenues provide access to [[EDSA|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] 
(EDSA) (C-4), the main highway in Metro Manila.

The Quezon City Hall, one of the highest city halls in the country is located along the Circle. Surrounding the city hall are spacious parks and open areas. Some of the national government agencies whose head offices are located in Diliman are the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Social Security Systems (SSS),  the [[National Power Corporation]], the [[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] (Philvolcs), the National Computer Center (NCC), the Office of the Ombudsman, the Departments of Agriculture (DA), Agrarian Reform (DAR), and the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

Surrounding the Circle are many important health centers and institutions. Along East Avenue stands the [[Philippine Heart Center]], the East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC), the [[National Kidney and Transplant Institute]], and the Philippine Mental Health Association. Along North Avenue is the Veteran's Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) and the [[Philippine Health Association]]. The Philippine Children's Medical Center and Lung Center of the Philippines is located along Quezon Avenue (R-7).

The [[University of the Philippines, Diliman]] (UPD) lies at the northwestern portion of Diliman occupying 4.92 km² of rolling land. See the [[University of the Philippines, Diliman#Campus|University of the Philippines, Diliman (Campus section)]]. Other schools are also located in the Diliman area, such as the main campus of the [[Philippine Science High School]] system.

Most of the rest of the area is devoted to residential purposes. Some villages in this portion of Diliman contain boarding houses where faculty and students of UPD stay.

===Commonwealth and Balara===
North of Diliman lies the Commonwealth area, so-named because of Commonwealth Avenue (R-7) (formerly called Don Mariano Marcos Avenue)(R-7) which runs through its center. This is primarily a middle-class residential area home to many subdivisions (residential associations) such as Don Jose Heights, Doña Carmen Subdivision, Ideal Subdivision, and Jordan Park Homes.  Along with this, Commonwealth plays host to one of the largest squatting communities in the country, specifically in the areas of Batasan Hills (formerly called Constitution Hills), and within the proposed National Government Center.  Commonwealth Avenue could possibly be the widest road in the Philippines, where in some parts can stretch to as much as 16 lanes across. 

At the heart of Commonwealth is the ''[[Batasang Pambansa]]'' (literally, ''National Lawmaking Center''), which is where the country's [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] holds its sessions. Many congressmen stay in houses in the surrounding subdivisions.

South of Commonwealth and east of Diliman is Balara. The area of Balara along [[Melchora Aquino|Tandang Sora]] Avenue is relatively poor, while the outlying areas contain some of the richest subdivisions in the city. Capitol Hills Subdivision, Ayala Heights, and Ayala Hillside Estates are where many rich individuals live. Adjacent to Ayala Heights and Ayala Hillside Estates is the Capitol Hills Golf and Country Club, a popular [[golf]] course.

===Tandang Sora===
This is located between Commonwealth to the east, North Ave to the south, Frisco to the west and Fairview-Sauyo to the north. It got its name from the Grand Old Lady of the Revolution, [[Melchora Aquino]] or ''Tandang Sora'', whose remains lie on her own backyard now known as ''Himlayang Pilipino''. The area is primarily residential with Projects 6 and 8 located here, as are other subdivisions, like Town & Country Gardenville. A large portion of Tandang Sora district is Barangay Bahay Toro, where a historic site of the Philippine Revolution known as ''Pugad Lawin'' is located. There are some industrial facilities especially near the Mindanao Avenue area. Culiat, a known Muslim compound is also to be found here. 

[[AMA Computer University]]'s central campus lies in the western portion of Project 8. Most of its students are studying information technology-related degrees.

===Loyola Heights===
Loyola Heights, to the southeast of Diliman is [[Marikina City]]'s gateway to Quezon City. The Aurora Boulevard (R-6) and Katipunan Avenue (C-5) provide easy access, but often experience traffic jams during rush hours.

The main campus of the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] is located in Loyola Heights. Beside the Ateneo is [[Miriam College]].

Loyola Heights is an upper middle-class and rich residential area that caters to students of the Ateneo de Manila, University of the Philippines, and [[Miriam College]], members of the schools' faculty and staff, and their families. La Vista Subdivision, north of the Ateneo, is a rich gated community where some of the top politicians in the country, including [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] live, as well as some of the country's old rich stay. Accessed through La Vista is Loyola Grand Villas, another gated community. Across Katipunan, the main thoroughfare of the area, are Varsity Hills and Xavierville, both upper middle-class subdivisions. Near these areas, and right beside La Vista, are some squatters' settlements, making the Loyola Heights area a place of mixed socio-economic classes.

===Cubao===
[[Image:People_Power_Monument.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[People Power Monument]] along [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue|EDSA]].]]
Cubao, south of Diliman is an important commercial area. At its heart is the [[Araneta Center]], along EDSA (C-4) and Aurora Boulevard (R-6). It contains a number of shopping malls catering to the middle-class Filipinos, such as the Ali Mall (named after the boxing legend Mohammad Ali), The Farmers Plaza, and the modern Gateway Mall. Department stores and retail centers can also be found here, such as Plaza Fair, Rustan's, Shopwise Supercenter, and Makro. At the center is Araneta Coliseum, often called the Big Dome. Many musical concerts, religious crusades, wrestling, cock-fighting and basketball games are held in this 50,000-capacity coliseum.

North from Araneta Center along EDSA (C-4) are numerous bus terminals. This is the area where many residents in Metro Manila go to in order to take bus rides to almost any point in Luzon as well as in the Visayas especially in [[Samar]], [[Leyte]], and [[Iloilo]]. It is also an intersection point for two of city's commuter trains (The EDSA MRT which travels from North to South, and the LRT-2 which runs from East to West).

===Libis===
[[Image:Libisqc.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Libis by night]]
Located at the southeastern corner of Quezon City, Libis is one of the newly developed commercial areas in Quezon City.  The Eastwood City Business Center was put up in the area. Several office and residential skyscrapers stand in Eastwood. Many local IT and consumer electronic firms are now located in Eastwood. Numerous bars and restaurants have been put up since 2000 along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5). Many of which are open-air restaurants and coffee shops reminiscent of Paris boulevards, but with a modern architecture. With this, Libis is fast becoming one of the hippest areas for night entertainment, similar to the [[Malate, Manila|Malate]] and [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]] districts of Manila.

West of Libis are many high-end gated communities like the Acropolis, Blue Ridge, Greenmeadows, White Plains, Corinthian Hills, and Corinthian Gardens. Further west are Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame. Camp Aguinaldo is the headquarters of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] while Camp Crame is the headquarters of the [[Philippine National Police]].

Located in Greenmeadows is the Manila Philippines Temple of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (the Mormons or LDS).  The Manila Philippines Temple was dedicated on September 25, 1984 as the 29th operating temple, to serve the half-a-million plus Filipino Mormons.

===Timog area===
[[Image:GMA_Network_Center.jpg|thumb|right|200px|GMA Network]]
Surrounding Timog Avenue (South Avenue) and Tomas Morato Avenue is a popular entertainment area. Located along these two avenues are many fine-dining restaurants and bars. Discotheques, [[Karaoke]] joints and comedy bars provide patrons with all-night-long recreation. It is home to many gay bars such as [[Chicos]], [[Adonis (landmark)|Adonis]] and [[Gigolo]], which are popular for their lively night time entertainment.

In the South Triangle (the area bounded by Quezon Avenue (R-7), Timog Avenue (South Avenue) and EDSA) are located the head offices of [[ABS-CBN]] and [[GMA Network]], the top TV media companies in the country. Most Filipino entertainment is produced here, and it is also the home of many Filipino celebrities. 

Most of the streets in the surrounding area were named in honor of the 20 [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]] who died in a [[plane crash]] en route to joining the 11th [[World Jamboree]]. A memorial stands in the center of a rotunda at the intersection of Timog and Tomas Morato avenues. Because of this, Timog area is also often called ''Scout Area''. In fact, one of the [[barangay]]s (small local government unit) in the area is called ''Laging Handa'' (always ready), the motto of the [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]].

===Novaliches===
The northern district is called [[Novaliches]] and is primarily residential. Its eastern portion is covered by the La Mesa Dam Watershed. The La Mesa Dam supplies much of northern Metro Manila's water supply. Adjacent to the watershed is the La Mesa Eco-Park, where you can stroll and unwind to Metro Manila's only forest space. Also located in the park are convention centers, picnic areas, swimming pools, an orchidarium, and a large lagoon for boating activities. It was also the site of the rowing and dragon boat events for the SEA (South East Asian) Games.  Rowing is regularly done here.

Premier malls have been built recently in this area such as SM City Fairview, Robinsons Place Novaliches, Fairview Center Mall, colleges like FEU (Far Eastern University)-NRMF, AMA Computer College Fairview Campus, National College of Business and Arts (NCBA), Montessori College; high schools like St. Theresa's School of Novaliches, Sacred Heart Academy of Novaliches, Our Lady of Lourdes School of Novaliches, Little Merry Hearts Montessori Center, Holy Child Academy, and many others.

Various [[Small_and_Medium-sized_Enterprise|SME]]s (small to medium enterprises) are also booming in Novaliches, with offices and services offering health care, money transfer, software development, online buy and sell, and many others.

The name Novaliches probably came from the surname of a Spanish governor general, Marquis de Novaliches. The town was once part of Rizal province before being ceded to Quezon City in the 1940's. This district is among the largest in the city, having shared boundaries with the two sections of Caloocan City, Valenzuela City, San Jose del Monte City in Bulacan and Montalban, Rizal. The oldest part of the city is in the town center, aptly named Novaliches Bayan. But because of population growth the density of people gradually widened reaching up the edge of the La Mesa Reservoir (Lagro and Fairview).

In 1999, a plebiscite was held among the voters of Quezon City to determine the cityhood of Novaliches. The proposed creation of "Novaliches City" would have resulted in the secession of 15 [[barangays]] from Quezon City. At the plebiscite's end, votes that were against the separation heavily outnumbered those that were in favor.

===Sta. Mesa Heights===
Sta. Mesa Heights is said to be where many middle class and upper middle class families reside.  Most of the areas in Sta. Mesa Heights are residential use. It is home to two prestigious institutions of learning, St. Theresa's College and the [[Lourdes School of Quezon City]].

===San Francisco Del Monte===
It was once an independent town during the Spanish era, but was later absorbed when Quezon City was created and expanded. Today it is a heavily populated district. Although it contains many residential areas such as Barangay San Antonio, there are many industrial facilities here, mostly found along Judge Juan Luna street.

It was founded by a Spanish Friar by the name of St. Pedro Bautista, OFM on February 17, 1590. It was meant to be a place for retreat from the Intramuros in Manila. The street name Retiro (now called N.S. Amoranto Sr. Avenue) came from the road that leads retreatants to a place of solitude nestled atop a hill.  The church located in San Francisco del Monte was the first building of the area.  The church is named after its benevolent Spanish friar and founder St. Pedro Bautista.

When it was first founded, it was around 2.5 km² in area. It reached what is currently Project 7 and 8 and all the way out to Timog Ave area. Currently the town is comprised of Brgy. Paraiso, Paltok, Mariblu, Damayan and Del Monte.

===Galas-Santol===
The Galas-Santol District of Quezon City is located in its southwest border with the City of [[Manila]]. The primary dividing line within the people of various financial capabilities is Araneta Avenue (C-3). West of the avenue lies the residential corner of many of the poorest in the city. Shanties predominate the area here, stretching from Araneta Avenue to Galas, while east of the avenue features the palatial mansions of some of the richest. SM City Santa Mesa lies at the end of the avenue.

===The Project areas===
The Project areas include Project 1 (presently Roxas), Project 2 (Quirino-A), Project 3 (Quirino-B), Project 4, Project 5 (presently Kamias), Project 6, Project 7, and Project 8. These areas are among the first residential subdivisions in the city developed by former Philippine Presidents Quezon, Quirino and Marcos.

==Economy==
[[Image:Katipunan_Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Katipunan Avenue, a major road in Quezon City. The trees on the right side of the image are part of the Ateneo de Manila University campus.]]
The commercial center in Quezon city is found in Cubao were you can find different shopping malls and the Aurora Tower. There is a farmers plaza and farmers market. Fiesta Carnival is an enclosed amusement park cum carnival which is located in the heart of the Cubao Commercial Center. You will also find the Araneta Coliseum, a venue for concerts as well as sports events.

Quezon City is also home to the major television broadcasting networks.  Major television networks ([[Associated Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[ABS-CBN]], [[GMA Network]], [[National Broadcasting Network|NBN]], [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Company|IBC]]) are all based in Quezon City.

Quezon City also has a vibrant nightlife. Tomas Morato Avenue is known as restaurant row where one can find a variety of restaurants from fine dining to fast food.  Bars and cafes also line up Tomas Morato. West Avenue also has its own version of restaurant row, but the difference is that West Avenue restaurants come in clusters, while Tomas Morato has restaurants in nearly the entire stretch.

And for the more adventurous, Quezon Avenue, Timog (South) Avenue and West Avenue are lined with nightclubs and other drinking joints. Some are seedy while others are wholesome.

===Communications===
Quezon City's communication system is powered by the Philippine Long Distance Telephone company, Globe telecoms, Bayan Telecommunications Corporation and others. Cellular network in the Philippines particularly the Metropolitan areas is increasing rapidly together with the low cost of calls and text messaging. Such big companies that control the cellular networks in the Philippines and Quezon City itself are Globe Telecoms, Smart Communications (PLDT) and Sun Cellular from Digitel.

[[Image:Science Education Complex.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ateneo de Manila University.]]
===Education===
The city has several major educational institutions in the country. Two of the most well-known are the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and the [[University of the Philippines-Diliman]]. It also houses some of the best medical schools of the Philippines including the [[Far Eastern University]] - [[Far Eastern University - Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation|Dr. Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation]]  and the [[University of the East]] - [[University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center|Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center]]. Business and management schools include Entrepreneurs School Of Asia located in Libis, [[Philippine School of Business Adminstration]] (PSBA) and [[National College for Business and Arts]] (NCBA). Other academic institutions include [[AMA Computer University]], [[New Era University]], [[Miriam College]], [[Saint Paul University (Quezon City)]], [[Trinity University of Asia]] (formerly Trinity College of Quezon City), and [[Siena College]].  

Notable secondary public schools include [[Philippine Science High School]], [[Quezon City Science High School]], and Quezon City High School. On the other hand, Quezon City holds the largest number of private elementary and secondary schools in Metro Manila. Notable private schools include [[Saint Mary's College of Quezon City]], [[Saint James College of Quezon City]], [[Claret School of Quezon City]], [[Saint Joseph's College of Quezon City]], The Dominican [[Angelicum College]], [[Lourdes School of Quezon City]], [[Saint Vincent Academy]], [[Holy Child Academy]], Sacred Heart Academy of Novaliches, [[Quezon City Academy]], [[School of Saint Anthony]], [[Jose Abad Santos Memorial School]] (JASMS), [[Holy Family School]], [[School of the Holy Spirit]], [[Stella Maris College (Quezon City)]], and [[Saint Theresa's College]].

===Transportation===
Currently, two elevated light rail systems run through Quezon City. MRT 2 - at Aurora Blvd (R-6) connecting Santolan (Pasig City) and Claro M. Recto Avenue (Manila). MRT 3 - at EDSA (C-4) from Taft Avenue (R-2 in Pasay City) until North Avenue.

An elevated rail transit system will be built in the next few years.  It will begin near Claro M. Recto Avenue (C-1) in Manila turning to Espana Boulevard (R-7) and entering Quezon City by cutting through the entire stretch of Quezon Avenue (R-7) and Commonwealth Avenue (R-7) and turns again at Regalado Highway (R-7), making its final stop at Almar Zabarte in Caloocan City.

Public transportation within the city, like in most of the urban areas in the Philippines, is facilitated mostly using inexpensive [[jeepneys]] and buses.  Tricycles give access to more rural or secluded areas, while Taxi cabs are used by the upper middle class to navigate any course.

[[Image:Qc map.png|thumb|right|250px|Map showing the districts of Quezon City.]]

==Government==
Like other [[cities in the Philippines]], Quezon City is governed by a Mayor and Vice mayor elected to three-year terms. The Mayor is the executive head and leads the city's departments in executing the city ordinances and improving public services. The Vice mayor heads a legislative council consisting of 10 members. The council is in charge of creating the city's policies.

Quezon City, being a part of the [[Metro Manila]] region, has its mayor in the Metro Manila Council headed by the [[Metro Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA). This council formulates development plans that seeks to solve the problems and improve the conditions in the metropolis.

Quezon City is divided into 142 [[barangay]]s (the smallest local government units) which handle governance in a much smaller area. These barangays are grouped into four congressional districts where each district is represented by a congressman in the country's [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].

:''See also: [[Barangays of Quezon City]].''

==History==
[[Image:QuezonUS.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon.]]
Before Quezon City was created, small towns existed in its area. These were San Francisco del Monte, Novaliches, and Balintawak. In [[August 23]], [[1896]], the [[Katipunan]] led by [[Andres Bonifacio]] declared a revolution against [[Spain]] in the house of Melchora Aquino in Pugad Lawin (now known as Bahay Toro, Project 8).

In the early 1900s, President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] dreamt of a city that would become the future capital of the country, replacing [[Manila]]. In 1938, President Quezon created People's Homesite Corp. and purchased 15.29 km² from the vast Diliman Estate of the Tuason Family. The National Assembly of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]] passed Commonwealth Act 502 known as the “Charter of Quezon City” originally proposed as Balintawak City, Assemblymen Narciso Ramos (father of President Fidel V. Ramos) and Ramon Mitra, Sr. (father of Speaker Ramon Mitra, Jr.) successfully lobbied the assembly to name the city after the incumbent president. President Quezon allowed the bill to lapse into law without his signature on [[October 12]], [[1939]], thus establishing Quezon City.

After the war, Republic Act No. 333 was signed by [[Elpidio Quirino]] on [[July 17]], [[1948]] declaring Quezon City to be the republic's capital. On [[June 16]], [[1950]], the City Charter was revised by Republic Act No. 537, extending the city's boundaries to its present area of 153.59 km². Baesa, Talipapa, San Bartolome, Pasong Tamo, Novaliches Poblacion, Banlat, Kabuyao, Pugad Lawin, Bagbag, Pasong Putik of the old Novaliches municipality cedes to Quezon City. The rest of the municipality cedes to Caloocan thus becoming North Caloocan.

In [[October]] [[1975]], Quezon City was the actual site of the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]" fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] & [[Joe Frazier]].

On [[November 7]], 1975 the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 824 of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] established [[Metro Manila]]. Quezon City became one of Metro Manila's 17 cities and municipalities. The next year, Presidential Decree No. 940 transferred the capital back to Manila on [[June 24]], [[1976]].

On [[March 31]], [[1978]], President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] ordered the transfer of the remains of President [[Manuel Quezon]] from the Manila North Cemetery to the erected Quezon Memorial Monument within the Quezon Elliptical Road.[[Image:Qchall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Manuel L. Quezon Monument and the City Hall.]]

On [[February 22]], [[1986]], the Quezon City portion of the [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] became the venue of the bloodless People Power Revolution.

On [[February 23]], [[1998]], Republic Act. No. 8535 was signed by President [[Fidel Ramos]]. The Act provided for the creation of the City of [[Novaliches]] comprising the 15 northernmost [[barangay]]s of Quezon City. However, in the succeeding plebiscite on [[October 23]], [[1999]], an overwhelming majority of Quezon City residents rejected the secession of Novaliches.

Quezon City is the first local government in the Philippines with a computerized real estate assessment and payment system. The City government developed a database system that now contains around 400,000 property units with capability to record payments.

===Mayors===
President Manuel L. Quezon acted as mayor from October 12 to November 4, 1939, 
pending the resignation from another position of his intended appointee, Tomas B. Morato. 
Since a president can, under Philippine government practice, hold multiple portfolios inferior to the position of president, Quezon took the position of mayor in a concurrent capacity. 
However, it is erroneous to view him as the first mayor, as a president holding a concurrent, lower, position is not listed in the roster of incumbents for those offices.
