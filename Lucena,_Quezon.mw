== History ==

Lucena was originally a barrio of Tayabas town, then the capital of the Province of Tayabas (now Quezon) which was explored by Captain Juan de Salcedo in 1571 & 1572. The town was founded by the Franciscan fathers, Juan de Plasencia & Diego de Oropesa between 1580 & 1583.

It was then called by the Spaniards "Buenavista" (beautiful scenic spots) because of its awe-inspiring scenic beauty.

It was then changed to "Oroquieta" in honor of the Spanish Gov-Gen. Oroquieta.  Then in the 17th Century it was changed to "Cotta" meaning a strong fort because forts or cottas were built to defend it from Muslim piratical raids.  Finally, on November 5, 1897, pursuant to an Orden Real Superior Civil, the community was named "Lucena" as tribute to the late Reverend Mariano Granja, a Jesuit prelate of the town of Lucena, Province of Andalucia, Spain who was responsible for the development of the barrio.  And on June 1, 1882  it became an independent municipality.

During the Philippine Revolution in 1896, the captain municipal of Lucena, Jose Zaballero, led the local revolutionaries.  However, the local revolutionary government was organized by Manuel Argüelles, with José Barcelona as president. After the declaration of Philippine Independence, Gen. Malvar took over Tayabas Province on Aug. 15, 1898.  Don Crisanto Marquez was elected municipal president during the first elections.

Lucena was the site of bloody struggles at the outbreak of the Filipino-American War in 1899. Upon establishment of a civil government in the Province of Tayabas by the Americans on March 12, 1901, Lucena was made capital of the province.  During WW II, Lucena was not spared from the grim realities of war at the hands of the Japanese who occupied the city on Dec. 27, 1941.  Fortunately, however, the city was not devastated by the war.  The Hunter ROTC guerillas succeeded in driving out the Japanese on January 25, 1945.  Quezon Province was formally liberated by the Filipino & American troops on April 4, 1945.

On June 17, 1961 by virtue of Republic Act No. 3271, sponsored by Cong. Manuel S. Enverga & Cong. Pascual Espinosa, Lucena became a chartered city.  The City of Lucena was inaugurated on Aug. 19, 1962 on the occasion of the 84th birth anniversary of the late Pres. Manuel L. Quezon.

Today Lucena is home to a population of 220,834 people (as of 2005) and is fast flourishing as an urban community and planning to build an Economic Zone.
