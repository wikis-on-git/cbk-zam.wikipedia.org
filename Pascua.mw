==Etimologia==    
In Anglo-Saxon times, Christmas was referred to as ''geol''<ref name="CathChrit">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm "Christmas"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1913.</ref>, from which the current English word 'Yule' is derived. The word "Christmas" is a contraction meaning "[[Christ|Christ's]] [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]." It is derived from the [[Middle English]] ''Christemasse'' and [[Old English language|Old English]] ''Cristes mæsse,'' a phrase first recorded in 1038.<ref name="CathChrit"/> The words for the holiday in Spanish (''navidad'') and French (''noël'') refer more explicitly to the Nativity. In contrast, the German name ''Weihnachten'' means simply "hallowed night."

Christmas is sometimes shortened to ''[[Xmas]]'', an abbreviation that has a long history.<ref name="Bratcher">Bratcher, Dennis. [http://www.crivoice.org/cyxmas.html "The Christmas Season"] ''The Voice,'' CRI/Voice, Institute, 2006.</ref> In early Greek versions of the [[New Testament]], the letter [[Chi (letter)|''Χ'']] (chi), is the first letter of Christ (''Χριστός''). Since the mid-sixteenth century ''Χ'', or the similar [[Latin alphabet|Roman]] letter [[X]], was used as an abbreviation for Christ.<ref>[http://www.askoxford.com/pressroom/archive/xmas Oxford English Dictionary]</ref>

==History==
===Pre-Christian winter festivals===

A winter festival was traditionally the most popular festival of the year in many cultures, in part because there was less agricultural work to be done during the winter. From a religious point of view, [[Easter]] was the most significant feast in the church calendar.<ref name="CathEast">"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05224d.htm "Easter"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1913.</ref> Christmas was considered less significant, and the early church opposed the celebration of birthdays of church members.<ref name="CathNatal">"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10709a.htm "Natal Day"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1913.</ref> The prominence of Christmas in modern times may reflect the continuing influence of the winter festival tradition, including the following festivals:

====Saturnalia====
[[Image:ChristJulii.jpg|thumb|180px|Disputed representation of Christ in the form of the sun-god [[Helios]] or ''Sol Invictus'' riding in his chariot. [[Third century]] mosaic of the Vatican grottoes under [[St. Peter's Basilica]], on the ceiling of the tomb of the [[Pope Julius I|Julii]].]]
{{Main|Saturnalia}}
In [[Roman]] times, the best-known winter festival was Saturnalia, which was popular throughout [[Italy]]. Saturnalia was a time of general relaxation, feasting, merry-making, and a cessation of formal rules. It included the making and giving of small presents (''Saturnalia et Sigillaricia''), including small dolls for children and candles for adults.<ref name="Bruma"> [http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/SF/WinSol.html Bruma], University of Tennessee</ref> During Saturnalia, business was postponed and even slaves feasted. There was drinking, gambling, and singing, and even public nudity. It was the "best of days," according to the poet [[Catullus]].<ref name="Sempronia">Sempronia, Julilla, [http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/242252 "Ancient Voices: Saturnalia], ''AncientWorlds'' 2004.</ref> Saturnalia honored the god Saturn and began on December 17. The festival gradually lengthened until the late Republican period, when it was seven days (December 17-24). In imperial times, Saturnalia was shortened to five days.<ref name="Mosley1">Mosley, John, [http://www.ips-planetarium.org/planetarian/articles/common_errors_xmas.html "Common Errors in 'Star of Bethlehem' Planetarium Shows"], ''Planetarian'', Third Quarter 1981.</ref>

====Natalis Solis Invicti====
{{Main|Sol Invictus}}

The Romans held a festival on December 25 called ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'', "the birthday of the unconquered sun."  The use of the title [[Sol Invictus]] allowed several solar deities to be worshipped collectively, including [[El (god)|Elah-Gabal]], a Syrian sun god; [[Sol]], the god of Emperor [[Aurelian]] (AD 270-274); and [[Mithras]], a soldiers' god of [[Persian]] origin.<ref name="CathMithra">"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10402a.htm "Mithraism"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1913.</ref> Emperor [[Elagabalus]] (218-222) introduced the festival, and it reached the height of its popularity under Aurelian, who promoted it as an empire-wide holiday.<ref>"Sol." ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Chicago (2006).</ref>

December 25 was also considered to be the date of the [[Solstice|winter solstice]], which the Romans called ''bruma.''<ref name="Bruma"/> It was therefore the day the Sun proved itself to be "unconquered" despite the shortening of daylight hours. (When [[Julius Caesar]] introduced the [[Julian Calendar]] in 45 BC, December 25 was approximately the date of the solstice. In modern times, the solstice falls on December 21 or 22.) The Sol Invictus festival has a "strong claim on the responsibility" for the date of Christmas, according to the ''Catholic Encyclopedia.''<ref name="CathChrit"/> Several early Christian writers connected the rebirth of the sun to the birth of Jesus.<ref name="Britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9082431/Christmas "Christmas], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006.</ref> "O, how wonderfully acted Providence that on that day on which that Sun was born . . . Christ should be born," [[Cyprian]] wrote.<ref name="CathChrit"/>

====Yule====
{{Main|Yule}}

[[Germanic paganism|Pagan]] [[Scandinavia]] celebrated a winter festival called Yule, held in the late December to early January period. [[Yule log]]s were lit to honor [[Thor]], the god of thunder, with the belief that each spark from the fire represented a new pig or calf that would be born during the coming year. Feasting would continue until the log burned out, which could take as many as twelve days.<ref name="Yule HC"> [http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&content_type_id=1252&display_order=1&sub_display_order=1&mini_id=1290 An Ancient Holiday] History Channel</ref> In pagan [[Germania|greater Germany]], the equivalent holiday was called ''Mitwinternacht'' (mid-winter night), ''Wintersonnenwende'' (winter solstice) and there were twelve ''Rauhnächte'' (harsh or wild nights), filled with eating, drinking and partying.<ref name="Reichmann">Reichmann, Ruth, [http://www.serve.com/shea/germusa/xmasintr.htm "Christmas"].</ref> As [[Northern Europe]] was the last part to Christianize, its pagan celebrations had a major influence on Christmas. Scandinavians still call Christmas ''Jul''. In English, the Germanic word Yule is synonymous with Christmas,<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Yule Yule]. ''The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language,'' Fourth Edition. Retrieved December 03, 2006.</ref> a usage first recorded in 900.[[Image:Origen3.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Origen]], a father of the Christian church, argued against the celebration of birthdays, including the birth of [[Christ]].]]

===Origin of Christian festival===

It is unknown exactly when or why December 25 was originally associated with Jesus' birth; the [[New Testament]] does not name a specific date. <ref name="Britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9082431/Christmas "Christmas], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006.</ref> [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] popularized the idea that Jesus was born on December 25 in his ''Chronographiai'', a reference book for Christians written in 221 AD.<ref name="Britannica"/> This date is nine months after the traditional date of the [[Incarnation]] (March 25), now celebrated as the [[Annunciation|Feast of the Annunciation]].<ref name="CathAnnun">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01542a.htm "The Feast of the Annunciation"], ''Catholic Encyclopedia,'' 1998.</ref> March 25 was also considered to be the date of the [[vernal equinox]] and therefore the creation of [[Adam]].<ref name="CathAnnun"/> Early Christians believed March 25 was also the date Jesus was [[crucifixion|crucified]].<ref name="CathAnnun"/> The Christian idea that Jesus was conceived on the same date that he died on the cross is consistent with a Jewish belief that a prophet lived an integral number of years.<ref name="CathAnnun"/>

The identification of the birthdate of Jesus did not at first inspire feasting or celebration. [[Tertullian]] does not mention it as a major feast day in the [[African Rite|Church of Roman Africa]]. In 245, the theologian [[Origen]] denounced the idea of celebrating Jesus' birthday "as if he were a king [[pharaoh]]." He contended that only [[sin|sinner]]s, not [[saint]]s, celebrated their birthdays.<ref name="CathNatal" /> His criticism may be inspired by his contact with [[Egyptian people|Egypt]] as Origen was born in [[Alexandria]]. 

The earliest reference to the celebration of Christmas is in the [[Calendar of Filocalus]], an illuminated manuscript compiled in Rome in 354.<ref name="CathChrit"/><ref>This document was prepared privately for a Roman aristocrat and is named after an artist who illuminated part of it. The reference to Christmas states, "VIII kal. ian. natus Christus in Betleem Iudeæ". It is in a section based on an earlier manuscript produced in 336.</ref> In the east, meanwhile, Christians celebrated the birth of Jesus as part of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (January 6), although this festival focused on the [[baptism of Jesus]].<ref>Pokhilko, Hieromonk Nicholas, [http://orthodoxeurope.org/page/12/4.aspx "The Formation of Epiphany according to Different Traditions]</ref>

Christmas was promoted in the east as part of the revival of [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] Christianity following the death of the pro-[[Arianism|Arian]] Emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. It was introduced to [[Constantinople]] in 379, to [[Antioch]] in about 380, and to [[Alexandria]] in about 430. Christmas was especially controversial in 4th century Constantinople, being the "fortress of Arianism," as [[Edward Gibbon]] described it. The feast disappeared after [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] resigned as [[bishop]] in 381, although it was reintroduced by [[Saint]] [[John Chrysostom]] in about 400.<ref name="CathChrit"/>

===Middle Ages===
[[Image:Don_Lorenzo_Monaco_001.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Adoration of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] by [[Don Lorenzo Monaco]] (1422).]]
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in the west focused on the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|magi]]. But the Medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the "forty days of St. Martin" (which began on November 11, the feast of [[St. Martin of Tours]]), now known as [[Advent]].<ref name="Murray">Murray, Alexander, [http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=13022&aid=&tgid=&amid=13022&g13022=x&g9142=x&g30026=x&g20991=x&g21010=x&g19965=x&g19963=x&e=true "Medieval Christmas"], ''History Today'', December 1986, '''36''' (12), pp. 31 - 39.</ref> In Italy, former Saturnalian traditions were attached to Advent.<ref name="Murray"/> Around the [[12th century]], these traditions transferred again to the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] (December 26 - January 6).<ref name="Murray"/> The evening of January 5 was called [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], a festival later celebrated in the [[Twelfth Night, or What You Will|play of that name]] by [[William Shakespeare]]. The fortieth day after Christmas was [[Candlemas]]. 

The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after [[Charlemagne]] was crowned on Christmas Day in 800. King [[William I of England]] was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.

By the [[High Middle Ages]], the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various magnates celebrated Christmas. King Richard II of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep were eaten.<ref name="Murray"/> The '''Yule boar''' was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. [[Christmas carol|Caroling]] also became popular, and was originally a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form.<ref name="Murray"/> "Misrule" — drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling — was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on [[New Year's Day]], and there was special Christmas ale.<ref name="Murray"/>[[Image:FatherChristmastrial.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Father Christmas]] persuades the jury of his innocence in ''The Examination and Tryal of Father Christmas'' (1686) by Josiah King]]

Often the "misrule" got quite out of hand. According to the [[History Channel]]'s documentary, ''Christmas Unwrapped: The History of Christmas'', there was even a Christmas custom pre-dating [[trick-or-treat]], in which revelers would knock at a door and demand the best portion of their host's food and ale, with "severe consequences" if he did not agree.

===The Reformation and the 1800s===

During the [[Reformation]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]]s condemned Christmas celebration as "trappings of [[pope]]ry" and the "rags of the Beast". The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] responded by promoting the festival in an even more religiously oriented form. Following the Parliamentary victory over King Charles I during the English Civil War, England's [[Puritan]] rulers banned Christmas, in 1647. Pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities, and for several weeks [[Canterbury]] was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist slogans.<ref name="Durston">Durston, Chris, [http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=12890&aid=&tgid=&amid=12890&g12890=x&g9130=x&g30026=x&g20991=x&g21010=x&g19965=x&g19963=x "Lords of Misrule: The Puritan War on Christmas 1642-60"], ''History Today'', December 1985, '''35''' (12) pp. 7 - 14.</ref> The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660 ended the ban, but most of the [[Anglican]] clergy still disapproved of Christmas celebrations, using Protestant arguments.

In Colonial America, the Puritans of [[New England]] disapproved of Christmas; its celebration was outlawed in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] from 1659 to 1681. At the same time, residents of [[Virginia]] and [[New York]] celebrated the holiday freely. Christmas fell out of favor in the United States after the [[American Revolution]], when it was considered an English custom.

By the 1820s, [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] tension in England had eased and British writers began to worry that Christmas was dying out. They imagined [[Tudor]] Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration, and efforts were made to revive the holiday. [[Charles Dickens]]' book ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', published in 1843, played a major role in reinventing Christmas as a holiday emphasizing [[family]], goodwill, and compassion over communal celebration and hedonistic excess.<ref name="Rowell">Rowell, Geoffrey, [http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=9784&aid=&tgid=&amid=9784&g9784=x&g9777=x&g30026=x&g20991=x&g21010=x&g19965=x&g19963=x "Dickens and the Construction of Christmas"], ''History Today,'' December 1993, '''43''' (12), pp. 17 - 24.</ref> 

During the early part of the 19th century, interest in Christmas in America was revived by several short stories by [[Washington Irving]] in ''[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon]]'' and "Old Christmas", which depicted harmonious warm-hearted holiday traditions Irving claimed to have observed in England. Although some argue that Irving invented the traditions he describes, they were imitated by his American readers.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/ch/in_america.htm ''The history of Christmas: Christmas history in America''], 2006</ref> The numerous [[Germans|German]] immigrants and the homecomings following the American Civil War helped promote the holiday by bringing with them continental European Christmas traditions still upheld in Catholic and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] countries on the continent. Christmas was declared a U.S. [[federal holiday]] in [[1870]].

===The 20th century and after===
[[Image:Now is it Christmas again (1907) by Carl Larsson.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|"Now it is Christmas again" (1907) by Carl Larsson.]]
In 1914, the first year of World War I, there was an [[Christmas truce|unofficial truce]] between German and British troops in France. Soldiers on both sides spontaneously began to sing carols and stopped fighting. The truce began on Christmas Day and continued for some time afterward.<ref>Baker, Chris, [http://www.1914-1918.net/truce.htm The Christmas Truce of 1914], 1996</ref> Although many stories about the truce include a [[Football (soccer)|soccer]] game between the trench lines, there is no evidence that this event actually occurred.

In the later part of the 20th century, the United States experienced controversy over the nature of Christmas, and its status as a religious or secular holiday.  Some considered the U.S. government's recognition of Christmas as a federal holiday to be a violation of the [[separation of church and state]]. This was brought to trial several times, including in ''Lynch v. Donnelly (1984)''<ref name="Lynch">[http://www.belcherfoundation.org/lynch_v_donnelly.htm ''Lynch vs. Donnelly] (1984)</ref> and ''Ganulin v. United States (1999)''.<ref name="Ganulin"> [http://www.becketfund.org/index.php/case/25.html ''Ganulin v. United States''] (1999)</ref> On December 6, 1999, the verdict for ''Ganulin v. United States (1999)'' declared that "the establishment of Christmas Day as a legal public holiday does not violate the Establishment Clause because it has a valid secular purpose."  This decision was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on December 19, 2000. 

Concerns regarding Christmas' combined Christian and secular nature continued into the 21st century. In 2005, some Christians, along with American conservative commentators such [[Bill O'Reilly]], protested against the perceived [[Christmas controversies|secularization of Christmas]]. Some believed that the holiday was threatened by a general [[secularization|secular trend]], or by persons and organizations with an anti-Christian agenda. The perceived trend was also blamed on [[political correctness]].<ref>Cohen, Adam. [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/opinion/04sun3.html?ex=1291352400&en=a1c102d8260b92e3&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss "This season's war cry: Commercialize Christmas, or else."] ''The New York Times,'' December 5, 2005.</ref>[[Image:Adorazione del Bambino - Beato Angelico.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Adorazione del Bambino'' ''(Adoration of the Child)'' (1439-43), a mural by Florentine painter [[Fra Angelico]].]]

==The Nativity==

{{main | Nativity of Jesus}}
The Nativity refers to the birth of Jesus. According to [[bible|biblical accounts]], Jesus was born to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], assisted by her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], in the city of [[Bethlehem]]. The birth took place in a stable, surrounded by farm animals, and the infant Jesus was laid in a [[manger]]. Shepherds from the fields surrounding Bethlehem were told of the birth by an [[angel]], and were the first to see the child.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202:1-16;&version=9; Luke 2:1-6]</ref> Christians believe that the birth of Jesus fulfilled many prophecies made hundreds of years before his birth.

Remembering or re-creating the Nativity is one of the central ways that Christians celebrate Christmas. The Eastern Orthodox Church practices the [[Nativity Fast]] in anticipation of the birth of Jesus, while much of the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]] celebrates Advent. In some Christian churches, children perform plays re-telling the events of the Nativity, or sing carols that reference the event. Many Christians also display a small re-creation of the Nativity, known as a Nativity scene, in their homes, using figurines to portray the key characters of the event. Live Nativity scenes are also performed in some areas, using actors and live animals to portray the event with more realism.<ref>Krug, Nora. [http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/11/25/travel/escapes/25ahead.html?ex=1165381200&en=58ee42b3737ff438&ei=5070 "Little Towns of Bethlehem"], ''The New York Times'', November 25, 2005.</ref> 

Nativity scenes traditionally include [[Biblical Magi|the Three Wise Men]], Balthassar, Melchior, and Caspar, who are said to have followed the [[Star of Bethlehem]], found Jesus, and presented gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]].<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%202:1-11;&version=9; Matthew 2:1-11]</ref> 

In the U.S., Christmas decorations at public buildings once commonly included Nativity scenes. This practice has led to many lawsuits, as some say it amounts to the government endorsing a religion. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a city-owned Christmas display, even one with a Nativity scene, does not violate the First Amendment.<ref name="Lynch">[http://www.belcherfoundation.org/lynch_v_donnelly.htm ''Lynch vs. Donnelly''] (1984)</ref>

==Santa Claus and other bringers of gifts==
{{main|Santa Claus}}
[[Image:1863 harpers.jpg|thumb|right|Santa Claus hands out gifts during the US Civil War in [[Thomas Nast]]'s first Santa Claus cartoon, ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 1863.]]
In [[Western culture]], where the holiday is characterized by the exchange of gifts among friends and family members, some of the gifts are attributed to a character called Santa Claus (also known as [[Father Christmas]], [[Saint Nicholas]] or St. Nikolaus, [[Sinterklaas]], [[Joulupukki]], [[Weihnachtsmann]], [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]] and [[Ded Moroz|Father Frost]]).

Santa Claus is a variation of a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[folk tale]] based on the historical figure Saint Nicholas, or ''Sinterklaas'', who gave gifts on the eve of his feast day of [[December 6]]. He became associated with Christmas in [[19th century]] America, and was gradually renamed Santa Claus or Saint Nick. In 1812, Washington Irving wrote of Saint Nicholas "riding over the tops of the trees, in that selfsame waggon wherein he brings his yearly presents to children."<ref name="Irving">Irving, Washington, ''History of New York'', 1812.</ref> The connection between Santa Claus and Christmas was popularized by the 1822 poem "[[A Visit from Saint Nicholas]]" attributed to [[Clement Clarke Moore]], which depicted Santa driving a sleigh pulled by reindeer and distributing gifts to children. The popular image of Santa Claus was created by the German-American cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] (1840-1902), who drew a new image annually, beginning in 1863. By the 1880s, Nast's Santa had evolved into the form we now recognize. The image was standardized by advertisers in the 1920s.<ref name="Mikkelson">Mikkelson, Barbara and David P., [http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/santa.asp "The Claus That Refreshes"], ''Snopes.com,'' 2006.</ref>

Father Christmas, who predates the Santa Claus character, was first recorded in the [[15th century]], but was associated with holiday merrymaking and drunkenness.<ref name=Harper/> In Victorian Britain, his image was remade to match that of Santa. The [[French language|French]]  [[Père Noël]] evolved along similar lines, eventually adopting the Santa image. In Italy, Babbo Natale acts as Santa Claus, while La Befana, is the bringer of gifts and arrives on the eve of the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]]. It is said that La Befana set out to bring the baby Jesus gifts, but got lost along the way. Now, she brings gifts to all children. 

In some cultures Santa Claus is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]], or [[Black Peter]]. In other versions, [[elf|elves]] make the toys. His wife is referred to as [[Mrs. Claus]].

The current tradition in several [[Latin America]]n countries (such as [[Venezuela]]) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the [[Baby Jesus]], who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes.  This story is meant to be a reconciliation between traditional religious beliefs and modern day [[globalization]], most notably the iconography of Santa Claus imported from the United States.

Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.<ref>[http://www.citybeat.com/archives/1996/issue304/cover1.html ''Santa: The First Great Lie'', essay by Mariane Matera, Citybeat issue 304]</ref>

==Christmas tree and other decorations==
{{main|Christmas tree}}
[[Image:DSC04820.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Christmas display in a Brazilian shopping mall]]
The Christmas tree is often explained as a Christianization of [[pagan]] tradition  and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice, which included the use of [[evergreen]] boughs,<ref>Robinson, B.A. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/xmas_tree.htm "All about the Christmas tree: Pagan origins, Christian adaptation, & secular status"] ''ReligiousTolerance.Org,'' December 13, 2003.</ref> and an adaptation of pagan [[tree worship]].<ref name=Shaman/> The English language phrase "Christmas tree" is first recorded in 1835<ref name=Harper>Harper, Douglas, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Christ Christ], ''Online Etymology Dictionary,'' 2001.</ref> and represents an importation from the German language. The modern Christmas tree tradition is believed to have begun in Germany in the 18th century.<ref name=Shaman>van Renterghem, Tony. ''When Santa was a shaman.'' St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1995. ISBN 1-56718-765-X</ref> From Germany the custom was introduced to England, first via [[Queen Charlotte]], wife of [[George III]], and then more successfully by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]]. Around the same time, German immigrants introduced the custom into the United States.<ref>[[Desmond Morris|Morris, Desmond]]. ''Christmas Watching.'' London: Mackays of Chatham, 1992. ISBN 0-224-03598-3</ref> Christmas trees may be decorated with [[Christmas lights|lights]] and [[Christmas ornaments|ornaments]]. 

Since the 19th century, the [[poinsettia]] has been associated with Christmas. Other popular holiday plants include [[holly]], [[mistletoe]], red [[amaryllis]], and [[Christmas cactus]]. 
Along with a Christmas tree, the interior of a home may be decorated with these plants, along with [[garland]]s and [[evergreen]] foliage.

In [[Australia]], [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], and to a lesser extent [[Europe]], it is traditional to decorate the outside of houses with lights and sometimes with illuminated [[Sled|sleigh]]s, [[snowmen]], and other Christmas figures. Municipalities often sponsor decorations as well. Christmas banners may be hung from street lights and Christmas trees placed in the town square.<ref>Murray, Brian. [http://www.historymatters.appstate.edu/documents/christmaslights.pdf "Christmas lights and community building in America,"] ''History Matters'', Spring 2006.</ref>

In the [[Western world]], rolls of brightly-colored paper with secular or religious Christmas motifs are manufactured for the purpose of wrapping gifts. The display of [[Christmas village]]s has also become a tradition in many homes during this season.

==Economics of Christmas==
[[Image:gifts_xmas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gifts under a Christmas tree.]]
Christmas is typically the largest annual economic stimulus for many nations. Sales increase dramatically in almost all retail areas and shops introduce new products as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies. In the U.S., the "Christmas shopping season" generally begins on [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], the day after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], though many American stores begin selling Christmas items in October and early November.<ref>Varga, Melody. [http://retailindustry.about.com/od/abouttheretailindustry/g/black_friday.htm "Black Friday], ''About:Retail Industry''.</ref> In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004]] prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. 

Most [[economists]] agree, however, that Christmas produces a [[deadweight loss]] under orthodox [[microeconomic theory]], due to the surge in gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001 Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone.<ref name="Deadweight">"The Deadweight Loss of Christmas", ''American Economic Review'', December 1993, '''83''' (5)</ref><ref name="econ">[http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=885748 "Is Santa a deadweight loss?"] ''The Economist'' [[20 December]] [[2001]]</ref>  Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory.

Other deadweight losses include the [[effects of Christmas on the environment]] and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as [[white elephant]]s, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.<ref>Reuters. [http://www.enn.com/today.html?id=9475 "Christmas is Damaging the Environment, Report Says"] December 16, 2005.</ref> This is mitigated by [[white elephant gift exchange]]s in which participants make the best of their white elephants, and by [[alternative giving]]. Some people have taken to selling their unwanted gifts shortly after Christmas on [[online auction]] sites.

In North America, film studios release many high-budget movies in the holiday season, including Christmas films, [[fantasy]] movies or high-tone dramas with rich production values.

===Commercialization of Christmas===

Since the late 1800's the economic importance of Christmas has lead to concerns over what is seen as the increasing commercialization of Christmas. The 1822 poem "A Visit from Saint Nicholas" had popularized the tradition of exchanging gifts and seasonal “Christmas shopping” began to assume economic importance.<ref>usinfo.state.gov [http://usinfo.state.gov/scv/Archive/2005/Dec/19-344398.html “Americans Celebrate Christmas in Diverse Ways”November 26, 2006]</ref> In her 1850 book "The First Christmas in New England", [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] wrote a character who complained that the true meaning of Christmas was being lost in a shopping spree. <ref>First Presbyterian Church of Watertown [http://www.watertownfirstpres.org/sermons/12-11-05.html “Oh . . . and one more thing”December 11, 2005]</ref>

The importance of the economic impact of Christmas was reinforced in the 1930's when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed moving the [[Thanksgiving]] holiday date to extend the Christmas shopping season and boost the economy during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>usinfo.state.gov [http://usinfo.state.gov/scv/Archive/2005/Dec/19-344398.html “Americans Celebrate Christmas in Diverse Ways”November 26, 2006]</ref> Religious leaders protested this move, with a 1931 [[New York Times]] roundup of Christmas sermons showing the most common theme as the dangers of an increasingly commercial Christmas.<ref>New York Times [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/opinion/04sun3.html?ex=1291352400&en=a1c102d8260b92e3&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss “This Season's War Cry: Commercialize Christmas, or Else ”December 4, 2005]</ref>

In 1958 [[Stan Freberg]] and [[Daws Butler]] recorded the [[audio theater]] [[satire]] [[Green Chri$tma$]], recasting [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] and [[Bob Cratchit]] in the rolls of advertising executives.  Due to the controversial nature of the piece, it recieved no commercial airplay until 1983.

==Regional customs and celebrations==

{{main|Christmas worldwide}}
Christmas celebrations include a great number and variety of customs with either secular, religious, or national aspects which vary from country to country:

In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], Christmas occurs during the summer. This clashes with the traditional winter iconography, resulting in oddities such as a red fur-coated Santa Claus surfing in for a turkey barbecue on [[Australia|Australia's]] [[Bondi Beach]]. New Zealanders also commonly celebrate Christmas at the beach, coinciding with the vibrant red flowering of the coastal [[Pohutukawa]] or "[[New Zealand]] Christmas Tree".

[[Japan]] has adopted Santa Claus for its secular Christmas celebration, but [[New Year's Day]] is a far more important holiday. In [[South Korea]] Christmas is celebrated as an official holiday, and in [[India]] it is often called ''bada din'' ("the big day"). Celebrations revolve around Santa Claus and shopping.

In [[Poland]], Santa Claus ([[Polish language|Polish]]: Święty Mikołaj) gives gifts on two occasions: on the night of December 5 (so that children find them on the morning of December 6), and on Christmas Eve (so that children find gifts that same day).  In addition to the major observances of Christmas, [[Germany|German]] children also put shoes out at their doors on the night of December 5, and find them filled with candy and small gifts the next morning.  Santa Claus ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: Mikulás), or [[Father Winter]] ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: Télapó) also visits [[Hungary]] on December 6, bringing small gifts, and is often accompanied by a black creature called Krampusz; while on Christmas Eve (Holy Night - ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: Szenteste)) the Little (Baby) Jesus ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: Kisjézus or Jézuska) delivers the presents.

In [[Spain]], gifts are brought by the Magi on Epiphany (January 6), and in [[Scotland]], presents were traditionally given on [[Hogmanay]], which is New Year's Eve. In recent times, both countries have also adopted gift-giving on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day.

The Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in [[Finland]] from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 (due to [[World War II]]). The declaration takes place in the Old Great Square of [[Turku]], Finland's official Christmas City and former capital. It is broadcast on Finnish radio and television. [[Sauna]] bathing has an important role in Finnish Christmas, often after the visit of [[Joulupukki]] on Christmas Eve.

Saint Nicholas' Day remains the principal day for gift giving in the [[Netherlands]] while Christmas Day is a more religious holiday.

In [[Russia]], ''Grandfather Frost'' brings presents on New Year's Eve, and these are opened on the same night. However, after the [[Russian Revolution]], Christmas celebration was banned in that country from 1917 until 1992. Even today, throughout the U.S. and Europe, several Christian denominations, notably the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], Puritans, and some [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalists]], view Christmas as a pagan holiday not sanctioned by the Bible.

===Social aspects and entertainment===
In many countries, businesses, schools, and communities have Christmas parties and dances in the weeks before Christmas. Christmas [[pageant]]s may include a retelling of the story of the birth of Christ. Groups may visit neighborhood homes to sing carols. Others do volunteer work or hold fundraising drives for charities.

On Christmas Day or Christmas Eve, a [[List of Christmas dishes|special meal]] is usually served. In some regions, particularly in Eastern Europe, these family feasts are preceded by a period of fasting. Candy and treats are also part of Christmas celebration in many countries.

Another tradition is for people to send cards to their friends and family members. The traditional greeting phrase on these cards is "[[Merry Christmas]]". Cards are also produced with messages such as "Season's Greetings" or "[[Happy Holiday]]s", so as to include senders and recipients who may not celebrate Christmas .

==Arts and media==

{{main|Christmas in the media|Christmas music|Christmas movies}}
Many fictional Christmas stories capture the spirit of Christmas in a modern-day [[fairy tale]], often with heart-touching stories of a Christmas [[miracle]]. Several have become part of the Christmas tradition in their countries of origin.

Among the most popular are [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' and [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. ''The Nutcracker'' tells of a nutcracker that comes to life in a young German girl's dream. Charles Dickens' ''A Christmas Carol'' is the tale of curmudgeonly miser [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]. Scrooge rejects compassion, philanthropy, and Christmas until he is visited by the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, who show him the consequences of his ways.

Some Scandinavian Christmas stories are less cheery than Dickens's. In [[Hans Christian Andersen|H. C. Andersen]]'s ''[[The Little Match Girl]],'' a destitute little girl walks barefoot through snow-covered streets on Christmas Eve, trying in vain to sell her matches, and peeking in at the celebrations in the homes of the more fortunate.

In 1881, the Swedish magazine ''Ny Illustrerad Tidning'' published [[Viktor Rydberg]]'s poem ''Tomten'' featuring the first painting by [[Jenny Nyström]] of the traditional Swedish mythical character ''[[tomte]],'' which she turned into the friendly white-bearded figure and associated with Christmas.

Many Christmas stories have been popularized as movies and TV specials. Since the 1980s, many video editions are sold and resold every year during the holiday season. A notable example is the film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', which turns the theme of ''A Christmas Carol'' on its head. Its hero, [[George Bailey]], is a businessman who sacrificed his dreams to help his community. On Christmas Eve, a [[Guardian angel (spirit)|guardian angel]] finds him in despair and prevents him from committing [[suicide]] by magically showing him how much he meant to the world around him. The [[1964]] [[stop-motion]] version of ''[[Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', narrated by [[Burl Ives]], became an annual holiday tradition on television after its first telecast. Perhaps the most famous animated television production is the 1965 production ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'', wherein Charlie Brown tries to address his feelings of dissatisfaction with the holidays by trying to find a deeper meaning in them. This special is noted for one character's retelling of the first Christmas. The humorous ''[[A Christmas Story]]'' (1983) in which the main character dreams of owning a Red Ryder BB Gun, has slowly become a holiday classic after receiving indifferent reviews, and is even repeated for 24 hours straight starting on Christmas Eve night and going on through Christmas Day on US cable channel [[Turner Network Television]] or [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]].

A few true stories have also become enduring Christmas tales themselves. The famous newspaper editorial, ''[[Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus]]'' is among the most well-known of these.

Radio and television programs aggressively pursue entertainment and ratings through their cultivation of Christmas themes. Radio stations broadcast carols and Christmas songs, including classical music such as the [[Hallelujah chorus]] from [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''. Among other classical pieces inspired by Christmas are the ''Nutcracker Suite'', adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet score, and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''Christmas Oratorio'' ([[BWV]] 248). Television networks add Christmas themes to their standard programming, run traditional holiday movies, and produce a variety of Christmas specials.
